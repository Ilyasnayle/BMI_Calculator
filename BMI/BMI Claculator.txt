#Exercise: Building a BMI Calculator Using Functions

#Objective: To test your understanding of functions in Python, you are required to build a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator.

#Background:

#The Body Mass Index (BMI) is a number calculated from a person's weight and height. It can be used to screen for weight categories that may lead to health problems.

#The BMI is defined as:

#BMI=weight in kilogramsheight in meters2

#Requirements:

    #Function Name: Your function should be named calculate_bmi.

    #Parameters: The function should accept two parameters:

      #  weight: The weight of the person in kilograms.
      #  height: The height of the person in meters.

 #   Return Value: The function should return the calculated BMI value rounded to two decimal places.

#    User Input: After defining the function, prompt the user to input their weight and height.

#Output: Display the calculated BMI to the user along with a health category:The BMI categories are:

  #  Underweight: BMI is less than 18.5
 #   Normal weight: BMI is 18.5 to 24.9
 #   Overweight: BMI is 25 to 29.9
 #   Obesity: BMI is 30 or greater

#Bonus Challenge Extend your program to also accept weight in pounds and height in inches. Convert these values to kilograms and meters respectively, before calculating the BMI. Remember:

#1 kilogram is approximately 2.20462 pounds. 1 meter is approximately 39.3701 inches.
